# Alchemy!
### What?
A simple iOS app designed to make the most out of your Skyrim alchemy experience. 


### Why?
Inspired by my long sessions on the Skyrim wiki pouring over the alchemy ingredients table to try and optimize use of my precious two void salts, I decided to create an interface for viewing the best ingredients combinations to optimize your time. I also needed something to practice new techniques with Swift and iOS development.
